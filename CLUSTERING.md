GPROC CLUSTERING TODO
=====================

gproc is a distributed library for storing shared data across multiple processes.
It runs perfectly in single-node mode, but requires special configuration to run
on multiple Erlang nodes.

This article is TODO, after macaba is more or less ready, and I have time to
test it on multiple node setup and prepare start script and readme for multinode
configuration.
